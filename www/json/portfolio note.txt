 /*
        portfolioItems is a list of the entries in the porfolio
        section of the site. Adding a new item is as simple as
        adding a new entry to the list. AngularJS will automatically
        display the item once the page is refreshed.

        ***** WARNING *****
        Objects need to be in order of category
        otherwise the drop-down menu will not
        generate correctly.

        The template is as follows:

        {
             name: '',
             title: '',
             subtitle: '',
             link: '',
             image: '',
             btnText: '',
             category: '',
             text: ''
        }
     */
